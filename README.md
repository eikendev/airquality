## About

This project enables your [ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266/overview) to continuously publish air quality data to the Internet.
The data is read from an MH-Z19 and sent via [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) to the broker of your choice.
Further, the data is displayed on a SSD1606 OLED.
